# Hello Flutter lovers ðŸ’œ ðŸ˜„ ðŸ’œ
This project will go over displaying markers on Google Map in efficient way. In mobile applications, maps are one of the components that users interact with the most. Especially when working with large datasets, displaying a significant number of markers on a map can affect user experience and lead to performance issues. In this article, I will explain how to efficiently display 1000 markers on a map using Flutter, and how to improve performance by grouping (clustering) markers. Additionally, we will walk through fetching dynamic marker data from Firebase Realtime Database. Finally, I will demonstrate how to create and manage marker data using Python.

The topics we will cover in this project:
* Creating and managing marker data with Python
* Fetching dynamic marker data from Firebase Realtime Database
* Displaying markers on a map with Flutter  
* Using clustering to improve performance for 1000 or more markers

Our goal is to manage large datasets efficiently while providing users with a smooth and seamless experience.
